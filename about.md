<p> I am a Geography and Rural Development graduate with skills in Remote Sensing, Geographic Information Systems, Research and Drone Piloting who aspires to apply Real-time mapping in detecting and monitoring the spread of epidemics.

Being around a community of young open minded individuals desirous of an impact-driven community geared towards innovative sustainable development gives me a great sense of satisfaction.

I love to volunteer in tech related activities targeted at young people and women. Contributing to @OpenStreetMap and @Hotosm projects are my favorite hobbies. </p>
